Dude they have had like 3 practices they should be 100 percent ready
"You call it complaining, I call it critiquing"
"They were moving their feet, pressuring up the ice like RK wants, and the effort was solid."
"I dont blame anyone for critiquing, but melting down when the team has an uninspiring 3rd after 2 really good periods is just unnecessary. What bothers me the most is when the analysis comes so dependent on the scoreboard, as if a few bad bounces, or soft goaltending is an indictment on the team as a whole"
People on these boards don't take observations well. Especially if it doesn't fit with the hive mind. Those that go against the grain usually are ridiculed and met with mockery
Should keep the same plan whether he signs here or not. Invest and improve the quality of the rest of the team to get as much scoring by committee as possible. You might be able get 2 more guys with Skinner's cap hit.
Firing our terrible GM straight into the sun before he can do any more damage.
"I was lucky enough to have my Blue and Gold # called for Season Tickets this year and even though I just recently moved down to Charlotte, NC, I decided it would be a terrible decision to let this opportunity pass. Between family and the friend I split the seats with, every game will not be used by people we know so I wanted to let you all know that I will have games available for purchase, if you want to PM me games of interest. We have a pair in 311, Row 9 right on the aisle! Go Sabres!"
"Raymond is probably my favorite to watch out of the early set of higher ranked guys outside of Lafreniere. He's smallish (5'10"") buy my word he wants the puck all the time so he can go do all sorts of fun things with it, like score in a variety of ways or set the table for his linemates and generally dangle the hell out of someone. Great fun, highly entertaining AND he's no slouch defensively. He has all of what we have come to expect out of Swedish trained players in his own zone, yet all of the creativity that they're trying to infuse back into their development model."
"Raymond and Holtz were dynamite together at U18, hope Sweden keeps them together for another tourney."
Rossi is going to be really really good. Would love to finally have an Austrian on the team again.
I wish I was going to be there tonight but I am 3 hours away. But I will be watching and wearing my gear
Looks like a pretty soft team up front for another year.??
"Olf is awesome, Cozens was very good Rhino, Vesey, Johansson, and Miller was great. Toronto's goals came from same turnovers and bad decisions from Scandella Risto and Dahlin. Need to clean that up with Dahlin. He's like a -6 in last 2 games. Other 2 will never change"
"It's generally accepted that despite the ten game win streak, the Buffalo Sabres were mostly bad during the 2018/2019 season. This is a pretty easy statement to make and correctly back up by simply looking at the standings, but I've been curious to figure out what exactly it is they are bad at and how they can fix it going forward in order to improve their place in the standings."
Buffalo Sabres were mostly bad during the 2018/2019 season.
"If Dahlin's season continues the way it has, it will be interesting to see if he decides to sign this summer or if he bets on himself and waits until after the 20-21 to sign an extension."
Dahlin isn't getting 10 mil. He isn't getting more than Provorov or Werenski. He'll get 6-7 over 6 or 8 for 8. Defensemen always get discounted.
They are in the sweet spot to do this now. Cap to do it around Dahlin now and the future. Would give another even strength focus point off of Eichel.
Why isn't Rasmus Dahlin playing more?
But if you dont think the praise is warranted keep in mind Rasmus Dahlin just finished the second best season in NHL history for an 18 year defensemen.
Dahlin has been brutal this season outside of the first 2 games. If anything he is getting too many minutes.
"Dahlin is still very young and prone to mistakes. He's going to earn his stripes over the next 3 or 4 years to learn directly in the NHL. 23-24 yr old Dahlin is going to be sic. But for now, let him learn via his mistakes, and Krueger is one hell of a coach to learn under, so far."
As for Dahlin not being everything some think he is. Okay? Show me a great player and Ill show you a couple of people who overrate them.
"Dahlin has been quite a weak 5v5 player this season, especially the last games. At least i think so."
"Dahlin is a very young rising star in this league, a surefire superstar in the making"
Dahlin of course is great QB at the powerplay and is getting the points already but he doesn't have to do a whole lot else right now and Buffalo is doing great.
to me it's a bit weird people already keep Dahlin so much better than the players that actually have to play defense all game and still provide offense on the side.
I lie that Buffalo is letting Dahlin play to his strengths. He's not going to out muscle NHL men in the D zone anyway.
I am not saying it's weird he is being sheltered. But i have seen it here multiple and multiple times again that many people think Dahlin already is the next one.
the whole point i'm trying to ask also is that has Dahlin been a little dissapointing on the defensive side to start this year, or were the expcetitions just too high for a player so young."
Considering we are 8-1-1 I think they will continue this trend with Dahlin until he shows that he deserves more minutes and gets the heavy minutes at the end when the game is on the line.
"You said yourself Heiskanen is playing more important minutes yet Dahlin still outscored him last year, on a much worse team"
"Its absolutely no Secret that some people do date Dahlin high because they take into account potential, his value As an asset and the fact he has all the necessary tools it takes to be the best defensemen in the game (skill wise) if he puts it altogether correctly during his prime"
"Defense is the hardest position in the NHL to grasp at a young age, Pronger said in an interview it takes most until they're 25 to really get the position in the NHL and show off what they can really do so Talents like Heiskanen, Dahlin, Makar are truly Exceptional."
