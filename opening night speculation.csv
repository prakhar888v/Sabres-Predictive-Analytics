"Gotta find some PP time for Miller, though- guess he just QBs the second unit? That first unit looks real good- only possible change would be to take out Skinner or Olofsson, put Miller at point, and have Dahlin as more of a roamer. Miller's got the clapper and might be more defensively responsible, and it leaves Dahlin free to dance down the wing if he likes. Just a thought, maybe an idea to shake things up if the PP isn't clicking at some point.
